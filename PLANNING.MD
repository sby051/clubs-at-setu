## Project Description
IT Carlow clubs and societies wish to establish an online registration system for students and staff.
The system will require students to create an account with a username and password. To join a
club/society students will need to include, student ID, phone number, email, date of birth and
upload a photo. Students will also need to provide a medical declaration and provide information on
any medical conditions, doctor information and next of kin contact information.


## Deliverables
- An application should be developed that implements one of the above scenarios. This
developed application must be fully GDPR compliant. The system should use cryptographic
methods to ensure GDPR compliance. The personal data (e.g., the names and phone
numbers) should be encrypted using a secure cipher. The passwords should be salted and
hashed using a secure hashing algorithm. The application should be developed using whatever
stack you are most comfortable with.

- A 1500 word report on the most important aspects of GDPR that need to be considered for
ICT developers when handling personal data.

- Provide the necessary design documents to prove that the application meets the “Data
Protection by Design” criteria of GDPR. Motivation: If the organisation that you are
building this application for has a data breach and the Data Protection Commission comes
knocking at that organisation’s door then they will have to show that data security and data
protection were key aspects during the design stages of the product development. If security
and privacy was not included in the design stage and only added as an afterthought then
your company could be in line for large fines. The company needs to create some design
documents that show how data security and data protection are embedded in their
application. Aspects of UML (e.g., Use Case Diagrams, Misuse Case Diagrams, etc.) which,
in your opinion, can be used to show a data protection officer the planning that went into
data protection, data encryption, password protection, retention of data, etc in the
development of the application.

- Assume that you are the Project Manager of a team of five people brought together to
analyse, design, implement, and test the solution for your chosen scenario. The project has
now reached the implementation stage, which is expected to last ten weeks. Create a
GANTT chart and PERT chart that covers the implementation and testing activities and
tasks. Assume that about half-way through the implementation stage there is a 20% over-run
in one of the tasks on the critical path. Explain how you would manage the resources
allocated to the remaining tasks to ensure the project completes on time.

## Submission
You need to submit one document that includes:
- A link to a video, preferably on YouTube, demonstrating the system (maximum 7 minutes)
- A link to a GitHub repository with your code
- A report on GDPR
- The software engineering diagrams, including the PERT or GANTT chart.
